\subsection{Complete Set of Commuting Observables}

A set of commuting operators $\{\hat{A},\hat{B},\hat{C},\cdots,\hat{X}\}$ is considered a complete set if their common eigenbasis is 				unique. Thus, the measurement of all quantities $\{A,B,\cdots,X\}$ will determine the system uniquely. The clean identification of such a Hilbert space can be quite challenging and a nice way of its measurment even more. Some possibly rather clean examples:

A rather clean example seems to be the detection of the spin in the
